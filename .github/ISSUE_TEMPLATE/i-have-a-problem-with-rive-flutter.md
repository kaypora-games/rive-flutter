Attaching runtime-exported `.riv` file that reproduces the issue is immensely helpful for our team to identify the problem as fast as possible and fix it.
Please also include the source (`.rev`) by [downloading a backup](https://rive.app/community/doc/exporting/dockj1y5YeDd#for-backup) from the Editor.
